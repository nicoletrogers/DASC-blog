The tuition data came from TuitionTracker.org and the salary data comes from Payscale.com. Overall this data breaks down colleges and their costs while also looking at the type of institution, degree length, and salary potential. For this data I want to explore what impacts the cost of a college and the if college truly counts as an investment.</description>
