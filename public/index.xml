The tuition data came from (TuitionTracker.org)[https://www.tuitiontracker.org/] and the salary data comes from (Payscale.com)[https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/best-schools-by-state/bachelors/new-hampshire]. Overall this data breaks down colleges and their costs while also looking at the type of institution, degree length, and salary potential. For this data I want to explore what impacts the cost of a college and the if college truly counts as an investment.</description>
