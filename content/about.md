Hi! My name is Nicole Rogers. I am a freshman Honors Fellow from Oregon. At the University of Arkansas studying Data Science. On campus I am a member of Pi Beta Phi. Besides staying busy with my sorority and schoolwork, I also enjoy cooking and hiking. My favorite hike I have ever done was in Banff, Canada hiking around Lake Louise.
