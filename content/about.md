Hi! My name is Nicole Rogers. I am a freshman Honors Fellow from Oregon. At the University of Arkansas studying Data Science. I initally fell in love with data science because of its interdisciplinary nature. However I have continued in it because it is exciting, applicable, and chaning the future. Outside from school I love to stay active and involved. I am a member of Pi Beta Phi and love trying out new hikes and coffee shops.
